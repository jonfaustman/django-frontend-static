========================
Django Frontend Static
========================

A basic Django application to install often used static files.

With the convenience of an installable Django application, easily add some of the most widely used static files.

There are no templates included. If you want a skeleton application built on HTML5 Boilerplate and Twitter Bootstrap then checkout `django-frontend-skeleton <https://github.com/jonfaustman/django-frontend-skeleton>`_. If you want a light-weight template built on HTML5 Boilerplate without any static files then check out `django-frontend-template https://github.com/jonfaustman/django-frontend-template`_.
